                    olby Allen is a multi-disciplinary developer based in South Florida. 
                    Her lifelong affinity for art and ability to view the small details as a whole 
                    has meshed into her passion for creating both tangible and intangible experiences

                    <h4>Ok! Enough of myself in third person...</h4>
                    
                    <h6>How did I get into coding?</h6>
                    <p class="grey-text">One day, at the beginning of my junior year of college, I got what I thought to be the most incredible app idea, atleast for someone like myself.
                            This idea not only drove me crazy from consistent dwelling thoughts, but drove me towards wanting to build it.
                            See, I was a psychology major, which in many ways lends a hand to app design based off human behavior, but also gives me an extensive background on how to handle
                            quantitative and qualitative data when it comes to UX approaches. But... How wold I build this app? I didn't know where or how to start. I'm not even sure I knew 
                            much at all about coding. So I started with designing it. By my senior year, I was bold enough to share idea and from peoples astonishment, 
                            I pushed forward into finding someone who could develop it for me... got an odd feeling around the idea of someone else building up my idea
                            and eventually decided that I would set out to do it myself. 
                            
                            From that moment I never looked back. 
        
                            After graduating from Boston College, I served as a title one teacher where I led the most proud jump in the schools immersive ways to utilize technologies in the classrooms
                            I managed the tech department. My curiosity on building this app grew, so I started at a coding bootcamp and from there not look back.
                            
                            I pushed the curriculum by building my first game with my students. "Bee's vs. Humanity", a game based from our studies on the ecosystem. 
                            I finished IronHack awarded with the most Intuitive Design.

                <!-- <p class="grey-text">So how is any writer supposed to pen a stunning piece of advertising copy — copy that sizzles and sells? The following tips will jumpstart your creative thinking and help you write a better ad. Consumers are inundated with ads, so it’s vital that your ad catches the eye and immediately grabs interest.&nbsp;</p> -->
               
                <!-- <p class="grey-text">You could do this with a headline or slogan (such as VW’s “Drivers Wanted” campaign), color or layout (Target’s new colorful, simple ads are a testimony to this) or illustration (such as the Red Bull characters or Zoloft’s depressed ball and his ladybug friend). Promises Credible Benefit: To feel compelled by an ad, the consumer must stand to gain something; the product is often not enough.&nbsp;</p> -->
               
                <!-- <p class="grey-text">What would the consumer gain by using your product or service?&nbsp;This could be tangible, like a free gift; prestige, power or fame. But remember: you must be able to make good on that promise, so don’t offer anything unreasonable. <br><br>Grabbing the consumer’s attention isn’t enough; you have to keep that attention for at least a few seconds. This is where your benefits come into play or a product description that sets your offer apart from the others. How you write your advertising copy will be based on where you will place your ad. If it’s a billboard ad, you’ll need a super catchy headline and simple design due to the speed at which people will pass.&nbsp;</p> -->
                <!-- <h3>100% Responsive</h3> -->
                <!-- <p class="grey-text">Online ads are similar; consumers are so inundated with Internet advertising that your ad must be quick and catchy. Magazine advertising is the most versatile, but this is solely dependent on the size of your ad and how many other ads compete with yours. If you have a full page ad, feel free to experiment; more page space gives you more creative space. If the ad is tiny, you’ll need to keep things as simple as possible.</p> -->
